knockoutjs observableArray transformation

Transform Array--an observable array that efficiently tracks another observable array with optional filtering, sorting, and/or transformation/mapping applied in any combination.

The transformed array could have entirely different objects that merely relate to the source array's objects.

It can also exactly track the source array's sort order while simultaneously applying a filter and a mapping, or sort entirely differently.
